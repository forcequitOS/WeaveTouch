# Weave Touch for iPad and iPhone
### My experimental playground for messing with Swift and SwiftUI on iOS, initially kickstarted by ChatGPT.

## Features:

95% of the Weave macOS experience

Pull-to-refresh and pinch to zoom gesture support

No sideloading required to run on iPads (via Swift Playgrounds)!

Clean design

*Really* lightweight and efficient

## Information:

**REQUIRES** an iPad running iPadOS 16.0 or later with Swift Playground 4.0 or newer installed to run directly, or a Mac with macOS Ventura or newer with Swift Playgrounds or Xcode in Mac Catalyst/iPad compatibility mode, or an iPhone running iOS 16.0 or later with a Mac to deploy the application to.

Built with Swift Playgrounds, Xcode, SwiftUI, WebKit, and of course, made (mostly) with ChatGPT.

## What's next?

Potential visionOS support??

We'll see at WWDC24 what else drops.

## Features Weave Touch is missing compared to Weave:

Toolbar customization (haven't figured out why, yet)

"Download Page" button (I simply don't need it at this time and implementing it would be difficult compared to on the Mac)
